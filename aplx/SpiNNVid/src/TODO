1. During initial phase, leadAp needs to send notification to host about the coreID of leadAP
   This is useful if we use CONFIGURABLE instead of USE_FIX_NODES
2. During initial phase, worker cores check if leadAp is running.
   LeadAp may fail to run (for various reasons), hence it is not necessary for workers to continue.

3. Do the test for reconfigurable network (not USE_FIX_NODES)


4. If there is packet lost during frame transmission, process whatever data it holds currently

5. After grayscaling: broadcast the pixels to external chips

- Test broadcasted MCPL step-by-step (dengan delay supaya bisa dilihat dengan io_printf

2 Oct 2016:
- If using 48 nodes, and all nodes send MCPL_BLOCK_DONE_TEDGE, the LEAD_CORE in root-node
  sometimes misses the packet (although not dropped).
  Solution:
  - split the MCPL and processed by two cores: NO! Too complicated for counting how-many
  - using FR: NO! also too complicated (its routing handle)
  - ignore MCPL_BLOCK_DONE and continue with the next task, assuming that sending result
    will long enough to make other nodes complete their tasks
