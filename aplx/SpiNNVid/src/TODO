1. During initial phase, leadAp needs to send notification to host about the coreID of leadAP
   This is useful if we use CONFIGURABLE instead of USE_FIX_NODES
2. During initial phase, worker cores check if leadAp is running.
   LeadAp may fail to run (for various reasons), hence it is not necessary for workers to continue.

3. Do the test for reconfigurable network (not USE_FIX_NODES)
