TODO:
0. Implement RLE
1. Implement gray-scaling
2. Implement fault-tolerance


In this version, let's use this approach:
1. The number of blocks is set with default:
   in Spin3: 4 blocks
   in Spin5: 48 blocks
   This value can be set with command sent via SDP_PORT_CONFIG.
2. We'll use chain mechanism for all data sent via SDP
