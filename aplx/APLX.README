TODO:
0. Implement RLE
1. Implement gray-scaling
2. Implement fault-tolerance


In this version, let's use this approach:
1. The number of blocks is fixed:
   in Spin3: 4 blocks
   in Spin5: 48 blocks
   Formerly, we use generic approach where the number can be changed
   via SDP. But we rarely use this, so, to make life simple, we make
   it fix now.
