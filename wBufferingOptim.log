What we want to do:
1. Optim the MCPL so that it carries more pixels -> done, sometimes it goes 
   around 25fps :)
   --> we have to set 30 in its expectation!
2. Send notification to host prior to sending the resulting frame
   --> result: many distortion, because MP cannot handle both traffic 
               simultaneously?
               --> lowering sdp rate might solve this, but fps gets dropped!
3. Overclock? First, fix the profiler on 3.0.1
