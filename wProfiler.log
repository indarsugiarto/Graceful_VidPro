In this branch, we want to properly manage the profiler program inside the pC-vidPro,
because we are going to use pC-vidPro for Graceful scenario with Q-Learning.

The idea:
- Core-1 will be used for the profiler app, and the remaining cores will be used
  for pC-vidPro (SpiNNVid*.aplx)
- The profiler program will have the same app-ID with SpiNNVid*.aplx
