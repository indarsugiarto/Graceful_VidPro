In this branch, we want to properly manage the profiler program inside the pC-vidPro,
because we are going to use pC-vidPro for Graceful scenario with Q-Learning.

The idea:
- Core-1 will be used for the profiler app, and the remaining cores will be used
  for pC-vidPro (SpiNNVid*.aplx)
- The profiler program will have the same app-ID with SpiNNVid*.aplx

- We also change the mechanism to send the frame info:
  Now, we use the same port with SDP_PORT_CONFIG, but using new cmd_rc SDP_CMD_FRAME_INFO
  wImg is in arg1.high, and hImg is in arg1.low

What TODO:
0. Properly move the profiler to core-1
   - The profiler should also collect info about fps
1. Create the image buffers in heap
2. Re-create the Gaussian filtering using the Laplace
3. Optimize the histogram equalization
